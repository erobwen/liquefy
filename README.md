# Important!

This repository is currently a work in progress, to split up and make readily usable npm packages out of the front end framework worked on as a monolith in this repository: https://github.com/erobwen/reactive-flow . 

This is a multi-repo, containing multiple interdependent npm packages. 


# To run demo

in the root directory: 

* npm install

in application/demo: 

* npm start

Demo is served at: http://localhost:5173/


# TODO: 

* Investigate if reactivity cycles can be improved. How to deal with work on priority level etc. Can we do it automatically by treating repeaters different first time they are refreshed.
